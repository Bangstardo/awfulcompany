This is the code for Awful Company.

The reason of this app software whatever name you wish, is to help people track their drug use, we will bring a place 
where they can measure and keep track of their own consumption for the sole purpose of knowledge. 

We are not trying to get people to quit any drug this is just a tool so they can know more about their active intake.

We do not hold judgements towards drug use as is a decision made by each individual. if you do hold a grudge on people 
because they hurt you in a drugged stated we for sure understand yet we do not condone any destructive critisism with harmful intent, you may leave if you choose to do so.

I got the name from an Albion Guild all regards.
